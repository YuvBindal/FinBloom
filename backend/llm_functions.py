Predict an estimated amount of microloan this individual would be eligible  for as the first number in your response. Secondly given the loan_terms column (in years). Generate a concise repayment schedule table, particularly the interest and payment intervals. Deduce the individua's credit history from their cibil score, and make ideal assumptions if you need more data. Lastly, your response should be in a JSON format such as this: {sample_response}.
